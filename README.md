DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). Its primary goal is to shorten the development lifecycle and deliver high-quality software continuously. Key principles of DevOps include:

1. **Collaboration**: Encourages communication and collaboration between development and operations teams.
2. **Automation**: Automates repetitive tasks like testing, deployment, and infrastructure management to increase efficiency.
3. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Regularly integrates code changes and automates their deployment to production.
4. **Monitoring and Feedback**: Continuously monitors applications and infrastructure to gather feedback for improvements.

Overall, DevOps aims to enhance the speed, quality, and reliability of software delivery.
